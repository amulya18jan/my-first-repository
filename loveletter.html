    <h1><b><i>I LOVE U ARCHIKA</i></b></h1>
    <pre><i><b>
        Hey Archika,
        I don´t know if this letter is going to relieve in any way the sheer agony of being away from you, but I would like you to know that I´m missing you like crazy right now!
        I miss the warmth of your arms and the gentle touch of your fingers running through my hair. 
        I miss your fresh breath, your lipstick rubbing on my lips and the sweet words that you´ve has always spelt out for me. I miss the sound of your high heels announcing your arrival, and I miss your hands anxiously looking for mine...
Deep in my heart, I´m missing you like crazy and I can´t bear the distance between us anymore, a distance that is totally against my will.
But the most important thing is that I am missing you like crazy and I want to get rid of this feeling as quickly as possible. All it would take would be to see you right now!

        I can’t forget the first time I saw you. I have never been not in love with you ever since. 
        You have made it so easy that I have forgotten what my life was without you. I am not versed in writing but I promise you I love you more than I can express in words. 

        This letter is just a thank you note for loving me and making me a better person. 
        
        My life is nothing without you.

            From:-</b></i>
        <h1 class="amulya">Yours AMULYA</h1>
